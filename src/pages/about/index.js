During my academic career, applied courses that I have completed thus far exposed me to programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript/JQuery, some experience in SQL, hosting a Postgre database to scale from an SQLite in development through AWS' RDS for a research project that I am currently pursuing, and web development tools/frameworks being HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), and Django. Though I am most comfortable with web development tech stacks, I am always eager to take on the challenge of learning through a project-based environment."

Personal projects and courses that I have completed have provided me with a deep understanding in languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, and MySQL. I have also worked with front end languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, React, and Spring boot. This semester, I am going to be expanding my skillset with classes such as computer security, algorithms, and what I am looking forward to most, software engineering. What I am looking forward to most this semester is the practical and real-world experience that I will be getting in software engineering, where we will be working with actual entities and businesses to hone our own skillset while also providing beneficial and efficient software to the client.
